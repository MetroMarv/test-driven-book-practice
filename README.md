# test-driven-book-practice

Practices from the [Test Driven](https://www.manning.com/books/test-driven) book from Lasse Koskela.

In the second and third chapter he describes TDD (Test Driven Development) by developing a simple template parser. One can follow the book by developing his/her own version of the template parser. That's what I did in this repository.

I used the described "Test" -> "Code" -> "Design" development cycle for this.
