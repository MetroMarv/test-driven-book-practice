## Template

* Template "${one}, ${two}, ${three}" with the values "one" -> "${one}", "two" -> "${three}" and "three" -> "${two}"
  should render as "${one}, ${three}, ${two}"
* Template "${one}, ${two}, ${three}" with the value "1" for variable "one", value ""${foo}" for variable "two" and
  value "3" for variable "three" should render as "1, ${foo}, 3"
